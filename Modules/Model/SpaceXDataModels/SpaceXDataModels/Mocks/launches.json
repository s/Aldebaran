With an estimated in-orbit lifetime of 30 years and the aim of securing Turkey’s orbital and frequency rights, Türksat 5B will be launched into an orbital slot at 42 degrees East. With 12 kW power, Türksat 5B will provide TV broadcasting and data communication services over a wide coverage area that reaches the entire Middle East, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the Mediterranean, North Africa, East Africa, South Africa and Nigeria. Apart from that, the satellite will also provide customized services for airlines and commercial ship operators around the world thanks to the fact that it operates in Ka-Band.","crew":[],"ships":["618fad7e563d69573ed8caa9","5ee68c683c228f36bd5809b5"],"capsules":[],"payloads":[{"dragon":{"capsule":null,"mass_returned_kg":null,"mass_returned_lbs":null,"flight_time_sec":null,"manifest":null,"water_landing":null,"land_landing":null},"name":"Türksat 5B","type":"Satellite","reused":false,"launch":"5fe3afc1b3467846b3242164","customers":["Turksat"],"norad_ids":[50212],"nationalities":["Turkey"],"manufacturers":["Airbus Defence and Space"],"mass_kg":3500,"mass_lbs":7716.2,"orbit":"GTO","reference_system":"geocentric","regime":"geostationary","longitude":31,"semi_major_axis_km":43968.125,"eccentricity":0.7916616,"periapsis_km":2782.114,"apoapsis_km":72397.867,"inclination_deg":18.35,"period_min":1529.208,"lifespan_years":15,"epoch":"2022-01-10T18:00:00.000Z","mean_motion":0.94166372,"raan":333.939,"arg_of_pericenter":184.4967,"mean_anomaly":257.5603,"id":"5fe3c080b3467846b3242190"}],"launchpad":{"images":{"large":["https://i.imgur.com/9oEMXwa.png"]},"name":"CCSFS SLC 40","full_name":"Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Space Launch Complex 40","locality":"Cape Canaveral","region":"Florida","latitude":28.5618571,"longitude":-80.577366,"launch_attempts":78,"launch_successes":76,"rockets":["5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec"],"timezone":"America/New_York","launches":["5eb87cddffd86e000604b32f","5eb87cdeffd86e000604b330","5eb87cdfffd86e000604b331","5eb87ce0ffd86e000604b332","5eb87ce1ffd86e000604b333","5eb87ce2ffd86e000604b335","5eb87ce3ffd86e000604b336","5eb87ce4ffd86e000604b337","5eb87ce4ffd86e000604b338","5eb87ce5ffd86e000604b339","5eb87ce6ffd86e000604b33a","5eb87ce7ffd86e000604b33b","5eb87ce8ffd86e000604b33c","5eb87ceaffd86e000604b33d","5eb87ceaffd86e000604b33e","5eb87cecffd86e000604b33f","5eb87cedffd86e000604b340","5eb87ceeffd86e000604b341","5eb87cefffd86e000604b342","5eb87cf2ffd86e000604b344","5eb87cf3ffd86e000604b345","5eb87cf5ffd86e000604b346","5eb87cf6ffd86e000604b347","5eb87cf8ffd86e000604b348","5eb87cf9ffd86e000604b349","5eb87cfaffd86e000604b34a","5eb87cfbffd86e000604b34b","5eb87d0effd86e000604b35c","5eb87d10ffd86e000604b35e","5eb87d11ffd86e000604b35f","5eb87d15ffd86e000604b362","5eb87d16ffd86e000604b364","5eb87d18ffd86e000604b365","5eb87d1bffd86e000604b368","5eb87d1cffd86e000604b369","5eb87d1effd86e000604b36a","5eb87d20ffd86e000604b36c","5eb87d22ffd86e000604b36d","5eb87d26ffd86e000604b371","5eb87d27ffd86e000604b372","5eb87d2affd86e000604b374","5eb87d2effd86e000604b377","5eb87d30ffd86e000604b378","5eb87d36ffd86e000604b37b","5eb87d37ffd86e000604b37c","5eb87d39ffd86e000604b37d","5eb87d39ffd86e000604b37e","5eb87d3bffd86e000604b37f","5eb87d3cffd86e000604b380","5eb87d3fffd86e000604b382","5eb87d41ffd86e000604b383","5eb87d42ffd86e000604b384","5eb87d45ffd86e000604b387","5eb87d46ffd86e000604b389","5eb87d4affd86e000604b38b","5eb87d50ffd86e000604b394","5ed981d91f30554030d45c2a","5eb87d47ffd86e000604b38a","5ef6a2e70059c33cee4a8293","5eb87d4cffd86e000604b38d","5fb95b3f3a88ae63c954603c","5eb87d4bffd86e000604b38c","5eb87d4fffd86e000604b393","5fd386aa7faea57d297c86c1","5ff6554f9257f579ee3a6c5f","600f9a5e8f798e2a4d5f979c","600f9a718f798e2a4d5f979d","60428aafc041c16716f73cd7","60428ac4c041c16716f73cd8","605b4b6aaa5433645e37d03f","6079bd1c9a06446e8c61bf76","6079bd399a06446e8c61bf77","5fe3af6db3467846b3242160","5eb87d4effd86e000604b390","600f9b6d8f798e2a4d5f979f","618faad2563d69573ed8ca9d","6161c94c6db1a92bfba85349","5fe3afc1b3467846b3242164"],"status":"active","details":"SpaceX's primary Falcon 9 pad, where all east coast Falcon 9s launched prior to the AMOS-6 anomaly.

historic pad that launched most of the Saturn V and Space Shuttle missions, including Apollo 11. SpaceX initially leased solely for Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, but the company has also used it for others as well following the damage to SLC-40 in the AMOS-6 explosion. After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling. The pad may also potentially be upgraded in the future for use with the

The target system consists of Didymos, 780 meters in diameter, and its moonlet Dimorphos, 160 meters. The DART spacecraft will intercept the double asteroid, using autonomous guidance to crash into the smaller one. Moving at about 6 km/s, the transferred momentum should alter Dimorphos's 12 hour orbital period around its companion by several minutes. The mission tests several technologies, including the Small-body Maneuvering Autonomous Real-Time Navigation (SMART Nav) used to differentiate and steer toward the target body and Roll-Out Solar Arrays (ROSA) with Transformational Solar Array concentrators. NASA’s Evolutionary Xenon Thruster — Commercial (NEXT–C) ion engine will also be demonstrated, although the spacecraft's primary propulsion is hydrazine thrusters. DART should arrive at Didymos in late September 2022, when it is about 11 million kilometers from Earth. Ten days before impact, the Italian Space Agency's cubesat LICIACube will be deployed to observe the collision and ejecta with its two cameras. Earth-based telescopes will be used to measure the altered orbit.","crew":[],"ships":["5ea6ed30080df4000697c913","5ea6ed2f080df4000697c90b","5ea6ed30080df4000697c912"],"capsules":[],"payloads":[{"dragon":{"capsule":null,"mass_returned_kg":null,"mass_returned_lbs":null,"flight_time_sec":null,"manifest":null,"water_landing":null,"land_landing":null},"name":"DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test)","type":"Satellite","reused":false,"launch":"5fe3b107b3467846b324216b","customers":["NASA"],"norad_ids":[49497],"nationalities":["United States"],"manufacturers":["Applied Physics Laboratory"],"mass_kg":670,"mass_lbs":1477.097,"orbit":"TLI","reference_system":"heliocentric","regime":null,"longitude":31,"semi_major_axis_km":6651.504,"eccentricity":0.00562,"periapsis_km":235.987,"apoapsis_km":310.75,"inclination_deg":64.77,"period_min":89.979,"lifespan_years":null,"epoch":"2021-11-24T06:29:02.000Z","mean_motion":16.00379554,"raan":235.9449,"arg_of_pericenter":158.71,"mean_anomaly":355.4,"id":"5fe3c4a6b3467846b3242192"}],"launchpad":{"images":{"large":["https://i.imgur.com/asp5L08.png"]},"name":"VAFB SLC 4E","full_name":"Vandenberg Space Force Base Space Launch Complex 4E","locality":"Vandenberg Space Force Base","region":"California","latitude":34.632093,"longitude":-120.610829,"launch_attempts":19,"launch_successes":19,"rockets":["5e9d0d95eda69973a809d1ec"],"timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","launches":["5eb87ce1ffd86e000604b334","5eb87cf0ffd86e000604b343","5eb87cfdffd86e000604b34c","5eb87d05ffd86e000604b354","5eb87d08ffd86e000604b357","5eb87d0affd86e000604b359","5eb87d0fffd86e000604b35d","5eb87d14ffd86e000604b361","5eb87d16ffd86e000604b363","5eb87d1affd86e000604b367","5eb87d1fffd86e000604b36b","5eb87d23ffd86e000604b36e","5eb87d25ffd86e000604b370","5eb87d28ffd86e000604b373","5eb87d31ffd86e000604b379","5ed983aa1f30554030d45c31","60e3bf0d73359e1e20335c37","5fe3b107b3467846b324216b","61bba806437241381bf7061e"],"status":"active","details":"SpaceX's primary west coast launch pad for polar orbits and sun-synchronous orbits, primarily used for Iridium NEXT and scientific satellite launches.

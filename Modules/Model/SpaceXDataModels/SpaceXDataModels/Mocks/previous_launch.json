SpaceX initially leased solely for Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, but the company has also used it for others as well following the damage to SLC-40 in the AMOS-6 explosion. After completing the necessary modifications, the first launch SpaceX performed on the pad was CRS-10 in February 2017. After SLC-40 was back online, 39A was upgraded to support Falcon Heavy and complete the removal of the shuttle-era Rotating Service Structure. More recently, a crew access arm and other safety equipment has been installed in order to launch commercial crew missions. 39A also occasionally launches other Falcon 9 missions between Falcon Heavy and Crew Dragon launches, depending on pad scheduling. The pad may also potentially be upgraded in the future for use with the BFR.","id":"5e9e4502f509094188566f88"},"flight_number":144,"name":"Starlink 4-5 (v1.5)","date_utc":"2022-01-06T21:49:00.000Z","date_unix":1641505740,"date_local":"2022-01-06T16:49:00-05:00","date_precision":"hour","upcoming":false,"cores":[{"core":"5f57c5440622a633027900a0","flight":4,"gridfins":true,"legs":true,"reused":true,"landing_attempt":true,"landing_success":true,"landing_type":"ASDS","landpad":"5e9e3033383ecb075134e7cd"}],"auto_update":true,"tbd":false,"launch_library_id":"3ddb1934-2b57-489b-b5d2-31d4990604eb","id":"61d5eca1f88e4c5fc91f1eb7"}],"totalDocs":144,"offset":0,"limit":1,"totalPages":144,"page":1,"pagingCounter":1,"hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":true,"prevPage":null,"nextPage":2}
